# Power Outages Analysis

This project analyzes the frequency of power outages across industrial, commercial, and residential areas using the Kruskal-Wallis H test. The goal is to determine if there are significant differences in power outage frequencies among these categories.

## Baseline Model

The baseline model uses the Kruskal-Wallis H test to identify significant differences in power outage frequencies across different areas. The data is cleaned, outage durations are extracted, and customer categories are classified. The test revealed significant differences among the groups.

## Improvement Plans

To enhance the model, we plan to conduct detailed group comparisons, add features like weather and economic data, and explore advanced machine learning methods. Feature engineering will create new variables, incorporate additional data points, create interaction terms, generate polynomial features, add temporal features, and convert categorical variables into numerical format. We will also integrate external data sources, improve visualizations, and validate the model with new data.
